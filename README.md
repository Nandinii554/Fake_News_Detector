# üì∞ Fake News Detector 

A web application built using Streamlit that helps users analyze news articles to determine whether they are **Fake News** or **Real News**. Users can input news content either by pasting the text directly or by providing a URL, from which the text will be extracted and analyzed.  

## üöÄ Features  

- Accepts input via **manual text entry** or **news article URL**.  
- Extracts text content from the given URL using **BeautifulSoup**.  
- Uses a **pre-trained machine learning model** to classify news articles.  
- Displays the classification result as **Fake News** or **Real News**.  
- Provides a **confidence score** for the classification result.  
- Supports **multiple ML models** (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).  
- Uses **TF-IDF vectorization** to transform text into numerical features.  
- Handles **basic text preprocessing** (removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters).  
- Ensures **real-time processing** with an easy-to-use interface.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  

- **Python** - Core programming language.  
- **Streamlit** - For building the web interface.  
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning library for model training and classification.  
- **BeautifulSoup** - For web scraping news articles.  
- **Joblib** - For saving and loading trained models.  
- **Requests** - For fetching web content.  
- **Pandas & NumPy** - For data handling and preprocessing.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - For data visualization.
